PubMed.pm Version 1.0.


WWW::Search class for searching National Library of Medicine
(PubMed). If you never heard of PubMed, Medline or don't know
the difference between a Abstract and Citation -- you then
can live without this backend.

This class exports no public interface; all interaction should
be done through WWW::Search objects.




See Also WWW::Search documentation. For all the latest
current fixed backends see:
